#  The Infra Blog

The Infra blog is currently hosted on GitHub and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with a Minima theme, further styled to fit with the Infra look. Anything in the main branch will automatically be posted using a set of built in GitHub actions. 

## Submitting posts to the blog

If you have an idea for a good blog post, ping us through the issues and we can discuss it.

For Infra employees, share your posts in a new branch (feel free to develop in the open and push your drafts as you go along). When you are ready to publish, submit a pull request and we can move it along. It may require a hero image along with other images to help build interest. Also think about a series of Twitter tweets that we can schedule out about the post to keep up the interest. Add them to the PR.

For posts that are internal confidential until publication, let's use our internal tools to collaborate.
