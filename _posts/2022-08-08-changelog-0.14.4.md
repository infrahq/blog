**0.14.4 just got released** and we are excited to share with you some great new features, including shell completion, user/group list truncating, and more.

First there is **shell completion**. If you have ever used infra and had to run the help command to remind yourself of the options, this feature is for you. Now **press the tab key to see a list of all the commands and subcommands**. Run `infra completion` to generate the completion script and it **supports bash, zsh, fish, and powershell**.

If you have a lot of users in a group and then you list them out, the list can be long and it can be difficult to read. **We will now truncate** that list to make that easier. But if you really want to see all the users, then **there is also an option to not truncate (--no-truncate)**. Also when viewing groups in the UI and CLI or using the API, you now see the number of users within each group. Another feature that was already in the CLI that has now been added to the UI is showing the list of providers a user has logged in with.
